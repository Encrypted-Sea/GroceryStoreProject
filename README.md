can hold 50 items at maximum capacity. Each of the items must contain the following: ID number, name, description, price. All of this will be read from a text file.
</p>

<p>They must be stored within the text file starting with item ID, name, description, and then price. Program must use ***classes*** to represent the items. 
Use data validation and document your program where necessary.
